# E-Commerce-Sales-Analysis
 E-Commerce Sales Analysis — End-to-End Data Analytics Project

Python • Power BI • Data Cleaning • Exploratory Data Analysis • Dashboard Development

Project Overview

This project provides a complete end-to-end analysis of an e-commerce dataset using Python for data cleaning & analysis and Power BI for dashboard development.

The objective of this project is to understand business performance across:

🔹Financial Performance

🔹Customer Insights

🔹Logistics & Fulfillment Efficiency

🔹Product Management & Inventory Optimization

🔹Customer Satisfaction & Returns

The project converts raw transactional data into actionable business insights to support data-driven decisions.


🛠️ Technologies Used

🔹Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)

🔹Power BI Desktop

🔹Jupyter Notebook / Colab

🔹DAX Measures

🔹Data Visualization Concepts

 1. Data Cleaning & Preparation (Python)

Key cleaning steps performed:

✔ Column name standardization

Converted all column names to lowercase and snake_case for consistency.

✔ Handling missing values

🔹Amount column → replaced missing values with median

🔹Text fields → filled with "Unknown"

✔ Date formatting

🔹Converted date column to datetime & extracted month for trend analysis.

✔ Cancelled orders

🔹Set amount = 0 only where status == 'cancelled'.

✔ Fulfilment type standardization

🔹Created fulfilment_type column for Amazon vs Merchant comparison.

 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (Python)
Key analyses performed:

🔹Revenue trends

🔹City-wise and state-wise sales performance

🔹Cancellation & return patterns

🔹B2B vs B2C comparison

🔹High-demand product categories

🔹Inventory planning recommendations

🔹Logistics performance (shipping times, fulfilment efficiency)

All results are printed clearly within the notebook.

3. Power BI Dashboard

A fully designed, interactive Power BI dashboard was created with:

Key KPIs:

🔹Total Revenue

🔹Total Orders

🔹Average Order Value (AOV)

🔹Total Quantity Sold

🔹Cancellation Rate

Dashboard Visuals

🔹Revenue by City (Top 10)

🔹Category-wise Revenue

🔹Amazon vs Merchant Fulfillment

🔹Weekly Sales Trend

🔹Monthly Revenue Trend

🔹Returns & Cancellations Overview

🔹Inventory Demand Levels

Filters Included

🔹Month-Year

🔹Category

🔹Ship-State

The dashboard uses a bright professional theme, clean layout, and business-focused insights.

 4. Key Insights
Financial Performance

🔹Strong overall revenue with consistent monthly trends.

🔹High contribution from top cities like Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Mumbai.

 Customer Insights

🔹Customer retention strongest in metro cities.

🔹Cancellation rate around 14%, influenced by fulfilment and courier performance.

 Fulfillment & Logistics

🔹Amazon Easy Ship showed faster shipping times compared to Merchant fulfilment.

🔹Around 89% of non-cancelled orders were processed on time.

Product & Inventory

🔹High-demand categories: Set and Kurta

🔹Recommended to maintain higher safety stock for high-demand categories.

🔹Low-demand items should be replenished carefully to avoid overstocking.

 5. Recommendations

🔹Strengthen fulfilment operations to reduce cancellation rates.

🔹Improve forecasting accuracy for high-demand products.

🔹Expand operations in top-performing cities.

🔹Optimize weekday staffing based on weekly sales patterns.

🔹Enhance customer service touchpoints to reduce returns.
